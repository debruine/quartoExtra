# quartoExtra

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of quartoExtra is to collect upgrades to quarto, such as df_print and dark/light mode toggling.

## Installation

You can install the development version of quartoExtra from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("debruine/quartoExtra")
```

Since this only works with quarto projects (not github readmes or pkgdown sites), see the [Quarto Demo](https://debruine.github.io/quarto_demo) website for examples.
